            <!-- Introduction paragraph about the journey -->
            <p>My journey as a software engineer started with a deep curiosity about how computers work. I remember my first "Hello World" program, and from there, my passion for coding only grew stronger.</p>

            <!-- Section on how the journey started -->
            <h3>How I Started</h3>
            <p>Like many others, I started with basic languages like <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. Eventually, I learned about **backend development** and started working with **Python and Node.js**.</p>

            <h3>Challenges I Faced</h3>
            <p>The biggest challenge was understanding **algorithms and data structures**. But with practice, I overcame it by solving problems on **LeetCode and HackerRank**.</p>
